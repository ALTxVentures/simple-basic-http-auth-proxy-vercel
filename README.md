# simple-basic-http-auth-proxy-vercel

üîê‚ñ≤ A simple basic HTTP Auth Proxy for Vercel, ideal for adding simple password protection to staging applications.

This project uses [node-http-proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy) inside a serverless function to add
basic password protection to ORIGIN site via HTTP Auth, requiring no code change to the ORIGIN deployment. This is designed
to add simple password protection to deployments during the UAT stage.
